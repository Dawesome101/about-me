      <h2>An Introduction</h2>
      <article>
        <p>As a <strong>Software Developer</strong> I strive to bring quality soft products, services and support to the software industry so that customers and end users alike have a smooth and painless experience while using them.<br><br>
        When I began in the software industry, I started out as a game tester with Nintendo of America. Over the years I performed various rolls within the testing department and the experience taught me a lot about the development cycle with an emphasis on debugging software.  Though it was a great experience, deep down I wanted to be making software, not trying break it. <br><br>
        With the goal of becoming a developer in mind I taught myself C#, a little HTML and a little CSS. I put those skills to work making games and tools for myself with the Unity Engine. Over the course of a total of four years, I'd made some progress and had a handful of various projects under my belt. I dabbled in <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>VR</strong>, <strong>3D modeling</strong>, <strong>rigging</strong>, <strong>animation</strong>, <strong>texturing</strong> and <strong>sound design</strong>.<br><br>
        Slowly, these experiences revealed to me that though developing games was fun, the world of code was where I <em>really</em> wanted to be regardless of the project. So, I adjusted my path to match my passion and I enrolled in <strong>Code Fellows</strong>, a coding bootcamp. With class courses underway, I currently purse the dream of being a software developer working professionally in the software industry.</p>
