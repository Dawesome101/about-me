# About Me

## Lab 02 & Lab 03

## Author: Daniel Awesome

### Lab 01

- Created a webpage with a basic biography describing my work experience and a few of the reasons I am where I am.
- Used CSS to the project to make it look pretty and tried to follow fluid-design principals.
- Created a fun interactive quiz using JS to answer some basic questions about me.

### Lab 02

- Edited the webpage by adding a simple list of job experience and a top ten list of my favorite video games.
- Edited and added CSS to style the page to display as nicely as possible.
- Wrote loops and arrays into the project adding a couple questions to the quiz and scored the user on how well they did.

### Links and Resources

- [Used This Color Picker: Coolors](https://coolors.co/ffe2d1-e1f0c4-6bab90-55917f-5e4c5a) to choose colors for my layout.

- [W3 Schools: CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) Used several pages within this site to refresh my memory of properties and attributes

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Looked for a few different answers to questions and found answers here.

#### Reflections: Lab 1

- I feel that this could have taken me a lot less time but i'm slow with CSS as I don't remeber all the properties off the top of my head.

- I spent a good 20 minutes scratching my head about why my JavaScript wasn't running. Back and forth, back and forth until I realized I'd spelled `scr` instead of `src`.  Ah, such is the way of programming.

- Im anxious to get more into what JavaScript can really do.  I don't have much experience with it so I'm egar to see where it goes.

#### Reflections: Lab 2

- Feel very slow again today.  I had to pull off of a few rabbit trails after messing around with them to long. I really need to get faster. I try to make things look really good and it costs me in time and I imagine in the industry, time management is really important.  Maybe I'll ask one of the speakers Code Fellows has about time management.

- Today, I was able to answer some questions for my class mates today and that felt nice. I think that means that at the very least, I'm understanding the content well enough to help others through theirs. Always room to improve and helping others helps me do just that as I get to hone my skills.

- Even though I'm slow, I really like what I'm doing. I intend to keep going and hope I can keep up with it as it scales.
