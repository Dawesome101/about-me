### Links and Resources

- [Used This Color Picker: Coolors](https://coolors.co/ffe2d1-e1f0c4-6bab90-55917f-5e4c5a) to choose colors for my layout.

- [W3 Schools: CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) Used several pages within this site to refresh my memory of properties and attributes

### Reflections

- I feel that this could have taken me a lot less time but i'm slow with CSS as I don't remeber all the properties off the top of my head.

- I spent a good 20 minutes scratching my head about why my JavaScript wasn't running. Back and forth, back and forth until I realized I'd spelled `scr` instead of `src`.  Ah, such is the way of programming.

- Im anxious to get more into what JavaScript can really do.  I don't have much experience with it so I'm egar to see where it goes.
